## 📂 Project Structure
The Skill Swap Platform is a web-based mini application developed using Python Flask, aimed at helping people exchange skills with one another in a collaborative and non-monetary way.

Whether you're good at web design and want to learn Python, or you're a digital marketer seeking Excel expertise — this platform enables you to find people, connect, and swap your skills in return.

It's a simple and practical use-case for creating value through collaboration.

💡 Use Case Example
Priya knows Photoshop and wants to learn Excel.

Arjun is good at Excel and wants to learn Photoshop.

Both register on the platform, list their skills offered and wanted.

They find each other and send a swap request.

Once accepted, they coordinate to teach each other.

After the session, they leave feedback.
